# advCalc
Reimplementation of calc from scratch.

## Build and Execute
Firstly, clean everything if you had built it previously:
```
$ make cleanall
```
Then start the build:
```
$ make
```
Now, you can start the calculator using:
```
$ ./calc
```
provided you have compiled it successfully. For a system wide installation do:
```
$ sudo make install
```
Now you will be able to execute it using:
```
$ calc
```

## How to Contribute
To look at the program flow you need to be able to debug. To do so first create
a debugger friendly executable. Start by removing any executable you had
previously built:
```
$ make cleanall
```
then build the source code using:
```
$ make CFLAGS+=-ggdb
```
which will enable **GDB** friendly debugging information. For other debuggers
use `-g` instead of `-ggdb`.
